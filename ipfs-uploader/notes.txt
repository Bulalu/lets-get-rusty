Box<dyn Error> is a type alias for a boxed trait object that implements the std::error::Error trait.
The Error trait is a standard trait in Rust that defines a common interface for error types in the Rust ecosystem.
It provides a unified way of working with errors in Rust, regardless of the underlying error type.

A boxed trait object, Box<dyn Error>, is an instance of any type that implements the Error trait, stored in a Box smart pointer.
The Box smart pointer is used to allocate the error value on the heap rather than on the stack.
 This allows error values to be returned across stack frames, or to be stored in data structures.
 The dyn keyword indicates that the trait object is dynamically sized.

The type alias Box<dyn Error> is often used as the return type for functions that might produce an error,
indicating that any error value should implement the Error trait and be stored in a Box.
This provides a convenient way of returning a wide variety of error types from a single function,
while still allowing the caller to inspect and handle the errors in a unified way.
